# AlarmClock
A Simple Python Alarm Clock

This is a simple alarm clock created using chatGPT 4 to help me wake up while white noise is playing and I can't hear my phone alarm.
You can add/delete alarms for the future, change the time, and turn it off. No snooze I never use it just set multiple alarms.

To run you need to install python firstly, the using powershell to install "pip install tkinter" "pip install tkcalendar" "pip install pygame". Then edit the python script with Python Idle or notepad to change the location of sound file and json file use foward / in the address. To create json file create a new text document and save it as a .json.
